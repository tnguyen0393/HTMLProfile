      Welcome to my webpage! This is an awesome website where you can get to
      know a little more about me. I began learning how to code HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript back when I had a 60+ hours a week job. Learning was a
      challenge for me because I have never been exposed to a markup language
      prior to my bootcamp. To overcome the hurdle, I made it a routine to study
      during my job breaks and stop by a coffee shop after work. On my spare
      time, I enjoy spending time with my friends, whether it is in person, or
      on a video game. I am also a huge foodie. I recently bough a sous vide and
      use it with almost every dish I make.
